# Legal and Ethical Considerations

This document outlines the legal and ethical boundaries for the Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) Lua scripting pipeline described in this repository.

The purpose of this section is to clearly define **intent**, **scope**, and **responsibility**, and to ensure that the project is used only for legitimate, educational, and research-oriented purposes.

---

## Project Intent

This project is intended to:

- Document Lua scripting pipeline architecture in UE4
- Explain runtime discovery and lifecycle-based execution concepts
- Support educational study, tooling development, and modding research
- Provide a neutral reference for understanding script VM integration

The project does **not** aim to enable misuse, exploitation, or circumvention of protections.

---

## No Targeting of Commercial Games

This repository:

- Does not target any specific commercial game
- Does not include game names, identifiers, or offsets
- Does not distribute proprietary binaries or assets
- Does not provide ready-to-use tooling against live applications

All concepts are presented in a **generic and abstracted** form.

---

## Respect for Software Licenses

Users of this project are responsible for:

- Complying with Unreal Engine licensing terms
- Respecting the licenses of any Lua integrations or plugins
- Following the terms of service of applications they interact with
- Ensuring that any experimentation is permitted by applicable licenses

This repository does not grant permission to violate any software license.

---

## Educational and Research Use Only

The content of this repository is provided strictly for:

- Learning and understanding engine internals
- Academic or personal research
- Development of legitimate tools or frameworks
- Exploration of scripting systems in controlled environments

It is not intended for cheating, bypassing safeguards, or unauthorized modification of software.

---

## Responsibility of the User

Any use of the information in this repository is done at the user’s own risk.

Users are solely responsible for:
- How the information is applied
- Where it is applied
- Whether such use is lawful and permitted

The authors and contributors assume no liability for misuse.

---

## Ethical Guidelines

When working with engine internals and scripting systems, users should adhere to the following ethical principles:

- Do not harm online communities or ecosystems
- Do not gain unfair advantage over other users
- Do not bypass safeguards designed to protect users or services
- Do not distribute tools that enable abuse

Ethical use is as important as technical correctness.

---

## Transparency and Documentation

This project emphasizes transparency by:

- Clearly documenting architecture and intent
- Avoiding obfuscation or hidden behavior
- Separating research concepts from real-world targets
- Encouraging responsible discussion and use

Transparency helps ensure that the work is understood and evaluated in context.

---

## Compliance with Platform Policies

Different platforms impose different constraints:

- Mobile platforms enforce sandboxing and security policies
- Distribution platforms have usage and content rules
- Open-source platforms prohibit malicious tooling

Users must ensure compliance with all relevant platform policies when applying these concepts.

## Legal and Ethical Scope Summary

| Area | Scope |
| ---- | ----- |
| Project Intent | Educational and research-focused |
| Target Applications | None (engine-generic only) |
| Proprietary Content | Not included |
| Exploitation | Explicitly out of scope |
| Responsibility | Lies entirely with the user |
| Ethical Use | Required and encouraged |

---

## Acceptable vs Unacceptable Use

| Acceptable Use | Unacceptable Use |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| Studying UE4 scripting architecture | Targeting live commercial games |
| Building tooling for owned projects | Bypassing protections |
| Academic research | Cheating or unfair advantage |
| Modding with permission | Violating terms of service |

---


## Summary

This repository is a **technical reference**, not a weaponized tool.

By keeping the scope educational, abstract, and transparent, the project aims to contribute positively to understanding Lua scripting pipelines in Unreal Engine 4 while respecting legal, ethical, and community standards.
